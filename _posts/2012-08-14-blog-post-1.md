# Majestic wines + Vivino Chrome extension

I have recently created a chrome extension to display the [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com) wine score on the [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk) website. While this extension is under review, you may clone [this repository](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/tree/main) and select 'Load unpacked' under 'chrome://extensions' to use this extension.

This extension works with [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk) and [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com), requiring host permissions to access both websites. To use, simply use the [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk) search engine and after a few seconds the wines and their ratings, price and region will be displayed in a table on the bottom right of the screen. [Example screenshot](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/blob/main/extension/screenshot.png). I recommend a maximum 'View per page' of 24, as Vivino will temporarily block your IP address if you submitted too many requests.

Some basic analysis can be found under in the [analysis folder](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/tree/main/analysis). Data was downloaded from [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk), limited to currently in stock red wines only. Half bottles, port and wines with a price over £100 were removed from the dataset. The Vivino rating and Majestic Wines price is [plotted for all countries](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/blob/main/analysis/plots/price_rating_all.png), and also for [all wine regions within each country](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/blob/main/analysis/plots/price_rating_france-multiple-regions-only.png). A [.csv file](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/blob/main/analysis/data/wines_rating-above-4.0_price-below-20.csv) is included containing wines with a Vivino rating above 4.0 and a price below £20, representing the greatest value.
