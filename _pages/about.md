I have recently passed my viva for a PhD in Condensed Matter and Materials Physics at University College London (2018-2022), under the supervision of Prof. Jochen Blumberger. 

The aim of my research was to better understand charge transport processes in materials through atomistic simulations.

Thesis (before minor corrections): 
[Charge transport in bulk hematiteand at the hematite/water interface](../files/Thesis-compressed.pdf)
